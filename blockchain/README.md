# Blockchain Development Tutorial for Developers

Becoming a Blockchain developer can seem a daunting task in the big picture, even for developers.

Why?

Because there are so many random tools involved. There’s the Truffle suite, Hardhat, Waffle, Web3.js, ethers.js, MetaMask, Solidity, Vyper, the Remix IDE, and so on.

Which one should you start with? How do they all fit together? Do you really need to know them all?

Well, I’m going to simplify this for you in this guide and walk you step by step through getting started as a Blockchain developer.

And this guide is FOR DEVELOPERS. If you have no clue how to code, then completing a basic web development course first would be a prerequisite.

But if you know basic JavaScript or a similar language and want to break into the Blockchain industry, then this guide will walk you through the tools you need and how they work together to create a simple decentralized application.
